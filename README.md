# Thesis

This repository contains the source code that is part of my thesis on the benchmarking of water column compression algorithms. The thesis itself can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gsmjynrcqqpz)

This repository contains the following projects

## testbench
A test bench to compare the performance of water column compression algorithm. 

## GWF
A python library for parsing and writing data in the generic water column format

## jpeg_2k_ref_implementation
Naive implementation of a water column compression algorithm based on using the Jasper JPEG2000 library to compress water column amplitude samples.
