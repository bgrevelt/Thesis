# JPEG2000 based water column compression algorithm #
This code has been written as part of my thesis on water column compression benchmarking. It's purpose is that of a naive reference implementation. At the time of writing, no effort has been put into optimizing the algorithm for speed or resource usage.
This implementation supports only data in the gwf format (also presented in the thesis).
The library is dependent on the Jasper library.
